\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

In a major pre-Ops activity that also served an an operation rehearsal and readiness check, we exercised the entire Data Management extant toolchain starting from raw data at a Data Facility to serving it to science users. Between December 2021 and May 2022 the DESC DC2 \citep{2021ApJS..253...31L} was reprocessed with Rubin Science pipelines V23 \citedsp{DMTR-351}.\footnote{\url{https://pipelines.lsst.io/v/v23_0_2/index.html}}
Between May and June the catalogs were ingested to Qserv, tutorials and documentation were updated and the Data Preview 0.2 data release was published on time by the Rubin Science Platform to the Data Preview delegates at the end of June.
This work was carried it out with the same systems and processes that will be used in production during Operations.
Planning for DP0.1 and DP0.2 are in \citeds{RTN-001}.
We shall discuss the process in the following sections:

\begin{itemize}
\item Management and communication is discussed in \secref{sec:management}
\item An overview of the processing is given in \secref{sec:processing}
\item Quality assurance and feedback to processing is discussed in  \secref{sec:qa}
\item Availability through the Rubin Science Platform is described in \secref{sec:rspqserv}
\item Community engagement, tutorials and documentation are discussed in \secref{sec:cet}
\end{itemize}
