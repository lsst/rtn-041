\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Between December 2021 and May 2022 the DESC DC2 \citep{2021ApJS..253...31L} was reprocessed with Rubin Science pipelines V23 \citedsp{DMTR-351}.\footnote{\url{https://pipelines.lsst.io/v/v23_0_2/index.html}}
Between May and June the catalogs were ingested to Qserv, tutorials and documentation were updated and the Data Preview 0.2 data release was made on time at the end of June.
A number of procedures were developed and practiced to achieve this.
Planning for DP0.1 and DP0.2 are in \citeds{RTN-001}.
We shall discuss the process in the following sections:

\begin{itemize}
\item  Management and communication is discussed in \secref{sec:management}
\item An overview of the processing is given in \secref{sec:processing}
\item Quality assurance and feedback to processing is discussed in  \secref{sec:qa}
\item Community engagement, tutorials and documentation are discussed in \secref{sec:cet}
\end{itemize}
