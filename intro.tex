\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

In a major pre-operations activity, which also served an an operations rehearsal and readiness check, we exercised the entire Data Management and System Performance extant toolchain starting from raw data at a Data Facility to serving it to science users and enabling science by a broad community of early adopter scientists. 
Between December 2021 and May 2022 the DESC DC2 \citep{2021ApJS..253...31L} was reprocessed with Rubin Science pipelines V23 \citedsp{DMTR-351}\footnote{\url{https://pipelines.lsst.io/v/v23_0_2/index.html}}.
Between May and June the catalogs were ingested to Qserv, tutorials and documentation were created and the Data Preview 0.2 data release was published on schedule in June 2022 via the Rubin Science Platform to approximately 600 Data Preview delegates.
This work was carried it out with the same systems and processes that will be used in production during Operations.
Detailed technical planning for DP0.1 and DP0.2 are in described \citeds{RTN-001}.
In this document we discuss the management and process by which DP0.2 was executed in the following sections:

\begin{itemize}
\item Management and communication is discussed in \secref{sec:management}
\item An overview of the processing is given in \secref{sec:processing}
\item Quality assurance and feedback to processing is discussed in  \secref{sec:qa}
\item Availability through the Rubin Science Platform is described in \secref{sec:rspqserv}
\item Community science, tutorials and documentation are discussed in \secref{sec:cst}
\end{itemize}
