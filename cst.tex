\section{Community Science} \label{sec:cst}

The Community Science team (CST) serves as the main interface for scientists working with the LSST data products and services. 
For DP0.1, the CST produced \href{https://dp0-1.lsst.io/}{detailed documentation} about the DP0.1 data products and services, authored a set of \href{https://github.com/rubin-dp0/tutorial-notebooks}{tutorials} and hosted a series of \href{https://dp0-1.lsst.io/dp0-delegate-resources/index.html\#dp0-delegate-assemblies}{virtual delegate assemblies} aimed at introducing the DP0.1 delegates to the data products and services via real science demonstrator analyses.
These activities were continued and expanded upon for DP0.2. 
New \href{https://github.com/rubin-dp0/tutorial-notebooks}{tutorials} and  \href{dp0-2.lsst.io}{documentation} were produced and the \href{https://dp0-2.lsst.io/dp0-delegate-resources/index.html\#dp0-delegate-assemblies}{delegate assemblies} were continued with a new series for DP0.2.

A delegate contributions github repository was set up by the CST for both \href{https://github.com/rubin-dp0/delegate-contributions-dp01}{DP0.1} and \href{https://github.com/rubin-dp0/delegate-contributions-dp02}{DP0.2}
The large and varied number of delegate contributions that can be found in these 2 repositories is a testament to the success of Data Preview 0.
