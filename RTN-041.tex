DM delivered software to operations to perform processing of the DESC DC2 data as well as enhancements to the
portal and Qserv for interaction with the results.  The release of this was called Data Preview 0.2 and the
production of the data products and publication of them were carried out in an operational manner. This
provides valuable insights for operational data releases.
